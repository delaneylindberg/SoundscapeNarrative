Composing Digital Media Soundscape Narrative Project

September 14, 2022: 

Currently in my repository I have included a screenshot of my work, an MP3 audio clip, and this explanation.  The Audacity file was too big to upload, so I have attached that elsewhere. 

To give a bit of an explanation of my project thusfar, I will begin with a recap of my intention: my hope is to capture the feeling of a panic attack through the sounds associated.  To explain further, when I have a panic attack in public spaces, there is a frightening sense of auditory overload that I want to capture.  To begin this process, I recorded a few sounds that I know would stand out to me: the sound of someone typing, a loud air vent, different songs playing in the background of the same space.  I toyed around with some of these recordings and didn't really like the way they fit together; it didn't have the effect I was looking for.  I kept the typing clip and found free downloadable sound effect recordings of a heartbeat and deep breathing.  These are currently pieced together as my starting point.
